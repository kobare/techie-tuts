I"–<p>The Menu component is a navigation drawer that slides in from the side of the current view. By default, it slides in from the left, but the side can be overridden. <br /><br />The menu will be displayed differently based on the mode, however the display type can be changed to any of the available menu types. <br /><br />The menu element should be a sibling to the root content element. <br /><br />There can be any number of menus attached to the content. These can be controlled from the templates, or programmatically using the MenuController. <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/menu" target="_blank">Read more from ionic framework docs</a></p>
